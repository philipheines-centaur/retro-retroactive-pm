# Retro & Retroactive Doc repo

Retro is a git-like utility for MS Office whereas Retroactive is the Github for
Retro.

Retro is still until this moment is just a MVP, we just expect that it will be
a small utility tool. There will be more work once the MVP is ready.

__Remote developers, I am still in discussion to prepare the coding cards. Will
prepare about this ASAP.__
